[UVa 10226: Hardwood Species](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=1167) abridged problem statement: Given a list of species of trees, print out each species followed by the percentage of the total tree population it represents. Each species should be on a new line and percentages should be printed to four decimal places. <!--more--> A `map` or `unordered_map` will lead to the simplest solution for this problem. My solution:

{% highlight c++ %}
{% include_relative downloads/uva/10226.cpp %}
{% endhighlight %}
