       Hi! My name is David Udelson. I am currently a junior at Cornell University
       pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My technical interests include
        systems programming, systems security, functional programming, and FOSS.
        I use arch linux and spacemacs. (include this?)
       I enjoy tweaking my system configuration (which can be found [here]) in my free time.

        My non-technical interests include Japanese language and culture, Aikido,
        nordic skiing, mnemonics, and ?? . I have a [collection] of chiptune music.

        Currently I am seeking a technical internship for summer 2017. Here is my [resume].
