title: What I'm Working On Now

*2021-02-19*

Currently I am participating in [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/), an online school for
writers. I hope to start writing a lot more!

I am also diving deep into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), since that's the
main technology we use at [ThreatX](https://www.threatx.com/). Currently I am
starting small with the [Rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), but after that I am thinking
about building a [raytracer](https://raytracing.github.io/), or maybe a [game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL006xsVEsbKjSKBmLu1clo85yLrwjY67X).
