title: What I'm Working On Now
---
*TL;DR: I'm trying to learn a lot in as little time as possible*

Right now I'm working on learning several new programming languages that align
with my interests. They are (in the order I plan to learn them):

- rust
- javascript
- [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/)
- clojure
- haskell
- kotlin
- julia

Along with javascript, I'm teaching myself react. The idea is that I will
soon be able to ship apps for all platforms using
[ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/),
but the ReasonReact docs assume prior experience with react, and Reason compiles
to javascript, so I'm starting with plain old react and vanilla ES6.
The story is similar on mobile for react-native, and I plan to fall back to
kotlin for android development.

I am also solidifying my knowledge of python and am trying to get a better grip
on emacs lisp, since I use that a lot but don't understand it at all.
