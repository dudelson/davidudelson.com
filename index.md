I am currently a junior at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/)
pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My technical interests include systems
programming, systems security, functional programming, and FOSS. I enjoy
using [Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and other software engineering power
tools (such as [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/)
and [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/)), and often
tweak [my system configuration](https://github.com/dudelson/dotfiles) in my free
time.

My non-technical interests include Japanese language and
culture, [Aikido](http://cornellaikidoclub.com/), and nordic skiing. I
also [play the tuba](/static/img/tuba.jpg), and am an avid listener
of [chiptunes](https://bandcamp.com/ubeatlenine).

**Currently I am seeking a technical internship for summer 2017**. Here is my [resume](/static/resume.pdf).

Right now I'm working on [Gobi](https://github.com/JordanGreissman/gobi), a
strategy game inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization V.
