I am currently a junior at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/)
pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My technical interests include systems
programming, systems security, functional programming, and FOSS. I enjoy
using [Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and other software engineering power
tools (such as [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/)
and [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/)), and often
tweak [my system configuration](https://github.com/dudelson/dotfiles) in my free
time.

My non-technical interests include Japanese language and
culture, [Aikido](http://cornellaikidoclub.com/), nordic skiing, tuba playing,
and [chiptunes](https://bandcamp.com/ubeatlenine).

Right now I'm working on [Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin), part of the
[Mirage OS](https://mirage.io/) project, as an intern for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

My resume can be found [here](/static/resume.pdf).
